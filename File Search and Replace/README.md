# Search and Replace Project

## Overview
This is a **C++ program** that performs two main functionalities:
1. **Search**: Finds and displays occurrences of a specific text in a file, including the line numbers and total count of occurrences.
2. **Replace**: Searches for a specific text in a file and replaces it with user-provided new text. The changes are saved directly to the file.
